# C++ Tetris
## Just a silly project
I just did this to see if it could be done. Relies heavily on bitwise- and bitshift operations. I wanted to do this so I could say I've programmed some Tetris :D

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 4.4 or later. This project uses `mingw32-make`, a version of Make that is part of the [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org) project.

To check if you have `mingw32-make` installed and to see its version, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mingw32-make --version
```
If you don't have mingw32-make installed, or if your version is older than 4.4, you will need to install or update it. You can download it from the MinGW-w64 website.

To build the game, use 
```bash
mingw32-make
```

## Running the Game
Just double click the built .exe file.
